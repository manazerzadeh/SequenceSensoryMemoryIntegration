# Sequence Memory Sensory Integration Experiment

The experiment was designed to see how memory and sensory information are combined when performing sequences. Based on the previous study, we hypothesised that memory and sensory are integrated in planning for the items. But the caveat was we were not sure if they could completely rely on memory to perform sequences (had a full memory of sequence). To adress the caveat, we designed the following experiment: 
Participants performed three different trial conditions in three sessions. On all conditions, a symbol was shown to determine the type of the condition. We had memory only, sensory only, and memory and sensory conditions. For the memory and memory sensory conditions, specific sequences corresponding to specific symbols were used. On the memory sensory and sensory conditions, alongside the symbols, the numerical cules were shown as well.
We had horizons 1, 2, 3, and 7 as another independent variable. We picked two sequences for each participants randomly as their trained sequences. 
The precues were set to 600-1000 ms randomly. ITI of 3000ms. Participants were asked to perform as fast as possible and as accurately as possible. They had to keep performing better than 80% accuracy. 
The experiment consisted of three sessions, each block consisted of 24 trials. Each session consisted of 12 blocks. All conditions are randomized in blocks. 
The length of sequence were 7.

The rule for choosing sequences (all trials), was not having runs of three digits (e.g. 123 or 321) and not having repetitions of digits (e.g. 22). Each sequence should have all the digits (numbers 1 to 5) atleast once.
